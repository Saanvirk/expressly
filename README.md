# Expressly
Expressly is designed to help people with autism who have difficulty speaking communicate more easily and naturally. It focuses on making communication personal and simple, so users can express themselves in a way that feels right for them.

I contributed in chatbot development and software frontend development. Through this project, I also had the opportunity to learn how to implement context-aware embeddings by leveraging user schedules, location, and conversation context stored in MongoDB to dynamically predict relevant communication icons, and how to fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL 1.0) with LoRA on custom datasets to generate personalized images.

I hope you enjoy going through the project!
